# Build it for me please :heart:

We love open source, and we want to support the open source community. This is why we're offering to help you work on stuff or work on it together.

**This can be:**

* Something that you need to get built but don't have the skills, and that will help others
* Something you want help with
* Something you want to tag-team with us and build


**Examples:**

* A command line to export CSV data from Notion and push it to Google Sheets. I volunteer at a shelter and this is how we can export our financials, but we have no one technical to work with.
* I'm trying my first contribution to `<somthing open source project>`, but having a hard time figuring out what to do. `..some more background information..`. Can we tag team on this?

## How?

You can [open an issue](https://github.com/rusty-ferris-club/build-it-for-me-please/issues/new/choose) with a suggestion for a project or contribution.
